        <h2>GYCO's Outdoor Performance Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            GYCO performed at Woodruff Park in downtown Atlanta. We were one of the volunteer groups 
            that provided food and essential supplies to the homeless. Performing in downtown Atlanta 
            has always been memorable because it meant an outdoor performance. The goal isn't to build 
            a finished product, but to create a tangible representation of an idea that can be shown, tested, 
            and improved upon. This hands-on process fosters problem-solving skills, 
            creativity, and resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
            This time, however, being outdoors posed unique challenges. As we gathered in the park, we quickly realized 
            that the weather would be a main obstacle for us to overcome. At 8:30 in the morning, the weather was heavily overcast 
            and extremely windy! Nevertheless, all of us persevered in these suboptimal conditions and 
            carried on with our performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this particular performance, GYCO members also prepared snacks and hygiene 
            supplies to give away to the homeless. Thank you all GYCO volunteers for contributing 
            not only your musical talents, but also essential supplies (deodorants, lip balms and granola bars) 
            for our most vulnerable members of society! GYCO was able to distribute 100 care packages to them.
