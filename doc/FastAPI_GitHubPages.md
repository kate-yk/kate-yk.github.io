# FastAPI_GitHubPages.md

Your GitHub Pages front-end can talk to a FastAPI back end running anywhere (including your own computer), but there are a few caveats:

1. **Local Development (tunneling)**
   - Run FastAPI on your machine (e.g. `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`).
   - Expose it to the Internet with a tunnel like ngrok or localtunnel:
     ```bash
     ngrok http 8000
     ```
   - You get a public URL (e.g. `https://abc123.ngrok.io`) that your GitHub‐Pages JS can `fetch()`.

2. **CORS**
   - In your FastAPI app enable CORS so your static site (e.g. `https://yourname.github.io`) can call it:
     ```python
     from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

     app.add_middleware(
       CORSMiddleware,
       allow_origins=["https://yourname.github.io"],
       allow_methods=["GET","POST","PUT","DELETE"],
       allow_headers=["*"],
     )
     ```

3. **Production Hosting**
   - Tunnels are great for dev, but for a “real” service you’ll want to host FastAPI on a reachable server or serverless platform:
     - **Free / low-cost VPS**: DigitalOcean, AWS Lightsail, Hetzner
     - **Platform-as-a-Service**: Railway, Render, Fly, Heroku’s free tier
     - **Serverless Containers**: Cloudflare Pages + Functions, Vercel Serverless, Netlify Functions (via Docker or edge adapters)

4. **DNS / SSL**
   - If you host yourself, point a custom domain (via A/CNAME records) at your server’s IP or load balancer.
   - Get HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt (Certbot) or via your PaaS provider’s built-in SSL.

5. **Workflow**
   1. Push static front-end to `gh-pages`.
   2. Deploy FastAPI separately.
   3. In your JS, `fetch("https://api.yourdomain.com/items")`.
   4. Auth with tokens (JWT) or a BaaS (Firebase Auth, Auth0) if you need user accounts.

So yes, your computer can run FastAPI and serve as your “own backend,” but to connect it to a GitHub Pages site you must expose it via a public URL (ngrok for testing, or a real host for production) and configure CORS.
