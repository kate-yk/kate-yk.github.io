        <h2>Celebrating Volunteer Excellence in 2024</h2>
        <p>
            The year 2024 was an amazing year for GYCO in terms of volunteer participation turnout!  
            Throughout the year, our young volunteers worked tirelessly, contributing their musical talents to GYCOâ€™s 
            great cause: offering hope, friendship, and encouragement through music to the underprivileged members of our 
            community. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To recognize their hard work and dedication, GYCO presented volunteer awards to its qualifying members based 
            on their accumulated volunteer hours. The top 3 honors went to the following individuals:  Jueon Kim and Yeoeun Kim 
            for first place, Seojin Lee for second place and Caden Thov for third place. Congratulations! Your strong 
            volunteerism is a great source of inspiration for others. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our volunteers could not have accomplished their work without the support of their families.  Parents drove countless 
            miles for the volunteers; carried instruments and equipment; organized setups and cleanups. GYCO would like to extend 
            its deepest gratitude to all the volunteers and their families. Thank you!  
        </p>
