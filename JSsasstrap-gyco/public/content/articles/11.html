        <h2>GYCO's Inspiring Visit to City of Hope Atlanta</h2> 
        <p>
            Today, GYCO performed at City of Hope Atlanta (formerly known as Cancer Treatment Center of America).  
            This is one of our dearest places to visit, as our music is heard and appreciated by cancer patients, their families, 
            and healthcare providers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            During our performance, we had a surprise visit from Mr. Jonathan Watkins, President and CEO of City of Hope Atlanta! 
            It was Mr. Watkins’ first time observing a GYCO performance in person. After the performance, he delivered a 
            heartfelt message of his gratitude for our volunteerism.  Mr. Watkins’ welcoming message was such a great treat 
            for our members and their families, especially after driving about 2 hours to visit the hospital in the morning! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear City of Hope!  GYCO will visit you again with more inspiring music soon.
