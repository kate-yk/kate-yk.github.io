        <h2>GYCO's Outdoor Performance Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            GYCO performed at Woodruff Park in downtown Atlanta. We were one of the volunteer groups 
            that provided food and essential supplies to the homeless. Performing in downtown Atlanta 
            has always been memorable because it meant an outdoor performance. The goal isn't to build 
            a finished product, but to create a tangible representation of an idea that can be shown, tested, 
            and improved upon. This hands-on process fosters problem-solving skills, 
            creativity, and resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
            This time, however, being outdoors posed unique challenges. As we gathered in the park, we quickly realized 
            that the weather would be a main obstacle for us to overcome. At 8:30 in the morning, the weather was heavily overcast 
            and extremely windy! Nevertheless, all of us persevered in these suboptimal conditions and 
            carried on with our performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this particular performance, GYCO members also prepared snacks and hygiene 
            supplies to give away to the homeless. Thank you all GYCO volunteers for contributing 
            not only your musical talents, but also essential supplies (deodorants, lip balms and granola bars) 
            for our most vulnerable members of society! GYCO was able to distribute 100 care packages to them.

        <h2>GYCO's Inspiring Visit to City of Hope Atlanta</h2> 
        <p>
            Today, GYCO performed at City of Hope Atlanta (formerly known as Cancer Treatment Center of America).  
            This is one of our dearest places to visit, as our music is heard and appreciated by cancer patients, their families, 
            and healthcare providers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            During our performance, we had a surprise visit from Mr. Jonathan Watkins, President and CEO of City of Hope Atlanta! 
            It was Mr. Watkins’ first time observing a GYCO performance in person. After the performance, he delivered a 
            heartfelt message of his gratitude for our volunteerism.  Mr. Watkins’ welcoming message was such a great treat 
            for our members and their families, especially after driving about 2 hours to visit the hospital in the morning! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear City of Hope!  GYCO will visit you again with more inspiring music soon.
